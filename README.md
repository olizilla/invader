# Invader

A random SpaceInvader generator in ~40 lines of fancy, arrays-all-the-things coffescript.

Inspired by the work of Jared Tarbell, an open-source-code-as-art hero.

Created Feb 2013 as an exercise in learning whats good about coffeescript, and arrays for all the things.

[Glitched](https://glitch.com/) in 2017 for fun and curiosity.

## Getting Started

Open [./index.html] in a browser and click.

Built with node, npm & coffescript.

- `npm start` will re-build main.js from `main.coffee`
- `npm watch` is better when editing, it'll rebuild `main.js` when `main.coffee` is saved.
